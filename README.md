# Sequele-business---Barraquinha-online
You can acess this aplication on this [link](https://sequele-business.herokuapp.com/home)

This is an ecommerce project.<br/>
Based on difficulties my neighbours used to face in order to buy foods and others have been difficulties to sell foods, then I had the idea to build this project, so we can manage this situation.<br/>

I mean, some cookers/chefs can register on our platform and sell their products, that way, others can acess this platform to buy them. Products can be delived or customer can stop by at cooker's workplace.<br/>
When chef signup, they receive a welcome notification in their email.<br/>
You can reset your password as well, in order to have a new one, in cause you forgot your current one.<br/>
